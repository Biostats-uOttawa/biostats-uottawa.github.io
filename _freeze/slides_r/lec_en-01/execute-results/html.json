Use this to comment your code \n\n- a series of commands can be grouped using braces `{ }`\n\n- write pretty code by following a [code style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) \n\n\n\n## help \n\n- when you need help for a function use `help()` or `?`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhelp(\"plot\")    # open help file for the function plot\n```\n:::\n\n\nor equivalently\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?plot\n```\n:::\n\n\n- or to search across all help files use `help.search(\"plot\")` or `??plot`\n\n\n## help \n\n\n\n- [Duckduckgo_it](https://duckduckgo.com/): Try online search\nYou'll be surprised how many other people have probably had the same problem and solved it.\n\n- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): There are thousands of questions relevant to R on Stack Overflow\n\n- [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?sort=votes) are the most popular ones, ranked by vote.\n\n- make sure you include a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610) to get the most useful advice. A reproducible example is a minimal example that lets others who are trying to help you to see the error themselves.\n\n\n## tips\n\n- use R regularly\n\n- learning R is not a memory test, you have your R scripts\n\n- you don’t need to know everything about R\n\n- don't stare at code for hours.\n\n- there are many ways to tackle a particular problem\n\n[the time invested now will be more than payed back in the future.]{.emph}\n\n\n# Thanks!\n\n\n\nCredit: I borrowed slides from [Alex Douglas](https://github.com/alexd106/).\n",
