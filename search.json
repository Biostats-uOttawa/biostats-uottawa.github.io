The book is covering an intorduction to the basic use of R (data loading, wrangling and plotting), as well as simple stats, programming, use of github and R markdown /Quarto with R Studio and VS code.\nThe book (still under development) is available in English and French. I will add more languages later this year hopefully with help of volunteers.\nHere are also a few slides about an intro to R only in english (slides).\n\n\nStatistical consulting \nAs Part of my service in the Biology department, I provide statistical consulting. Please just contact me to book an appointment to discuss your stat problems.\nPlease bring with you (or send me in advance):\n\nyour data\nyour R code (should at least load the data into R)\na clear working hypothesis\n\nStatistical consulting does not mean that you have to add me as a co-author. I just ask that you add me to the “Acknowledgements” of your thesis and manuscript/article. Repeated consulting on the same problem and my implication on developing project specific coding/analysis might lead to co-authorship, but this usually all comes naturally and is always discussed openly with the student(s) and PI(s). As yet, I have never requested to become a co-author and I was offered co-authorship for 3 manuscripts over &gt; 50 projects discussed.\n\n\n\n\nCours de biostatistique à uOttawa\nLe site regroupe les différentes ressources développées par Julien Martin pour les cours de biostatistiques à uOttawa\n\nBiostatistiques appliquées avec R (BIO 4X58) \n\nCours offerts aux étudiant au baccaulauréat et aux étudiants gradués en anglais et en français\nPré-requis:\n\ncours d’introduction au statistiques recommandée\nAucune connaissance de R et des statistiques requises\n\nBIO4158 anglais (cours / manuel)\nBIO4558 français (cours / manuel)\n\n\n\nBiostatistiques avancées et science ouverte (BIO8940) \n\nCours bilingues offerts aux étudiants gradués\nPré-requis:\n\nconnaissances fonctionelle de R (chargement de données, graphique et statistiques de bases)\nbonne compréhension des modèles linéaires\nEssentiellement Bio4x58\n\ncours / manuel\n\n\n\n\nLivre d’introduction à R: Sur le chemin de l’enf-R \nIl s’agit d’un livre d’introduction à R avec une approche multilingue. Le livre couvre une introduction à l’utilisation de base de R (chargement de données, manipulation et traçage), ainsi que des statistiques simples, la programmation, l’utilisation de github et de R markdown /Quarto avec R Studio et VS code.\nLe livre (encore en développement) est disponible en anglais et français. J’ajouterai d’autres langues plus tard dans l’année, avec l’aide de volontaires.\nVoici également quelques diapositives sur une introduction à R uniquement en anglais (slides).\n\n\nConsultations en statistique \nJe fournis des services de consultation en biostatistique dans le cadre de mon service au département de Biologie. Pour discuter de vos problèmes en statistiques, veuillez simplement me contacter pour prendre un rendez-vous.\nVeuillez avoir avec vous (ou me l’envoyer en avance):\n\nvos données\nvotre code R (au minimum capable de charger les données)\nune hypothèse de travail ou question biologique claire\n\nUne consultation statistiques n’implique pas de m’ajouter en tant ue que co-auteur. Je demande simplement que vous m’ajoutiez au Remerciements/Acknowledgements de votre thèse et/ou manuscript. Je reconnais que dans certains cas, e.g. nombres répétées de consultations sur le même projet incluant le développement de code et analyse spécifique au projet, je peux devenir co-auteur sur un projet. Cette discussion a habituellement lieu de manière naturelle et à toujours lieu de manière ouverte et ransparente avec les personnes impliquées, étudiant.e.s et PI.s. Jusqu’à maintenant, je n’ai jamais demandé à être co-auteur, et je suis devenu co-auteur sur 3 articles et j’ai été consulté pour plus de 50 projets."
