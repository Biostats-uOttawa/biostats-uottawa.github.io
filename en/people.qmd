Julien is an Associate Professor at the University of Ottawa and has
been teaching (and learning) R for the last 15 years.

I created the websites using `Quarto`, `R`, `revealjs`, `mermaid.js` and
`graphViz`. I developed the theme for the slides based on the [xaringan
blackboard
theme](https://github.com/juancarloscastillo/xaringan-themes-blackboard).
