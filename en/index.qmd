This site regroup the different resources developed for the biostatistic courses at the university of Ottawa
by [Julien Martin](people.qmd)  

# Biostatistic courses at uOttawa {#en}

## Applied biostatistics with R (BIO 4X58)

::: {layout=[22,78]}

[![](../img/hex/bio4x58_logo_hex.png){width="150"}][4158_course] 

::::{}
  * Offered to both undergraduate and graduate students in english and french
  * Prerequisite:
    * an introduction class to statisticis is good to have
    * No (or limited) knowledge of R and no (or limited) knowledge of stats expected.
  * BIO4158 english ([Course site][4158_course] / [Course manual][4158_manual])
  * BIO4558 french ([Course site][4558_course] / [Course manual][4558_manual])

## Advanced biostatistics and open science (BIO 8940)

::: {layout=[22,78]}
[![](../img/hex/bio8940_logo_hex.png){width="150"}][8940_course] 

::::{}
  * Bilingual course for graduate students
  * Prerequisite:
    * a functional knowledge of R (loading data, running basic linear models, and making plots) 
    * a good understanding of linear models
    * essentially Bio8940 is a great next steps after completing Bio4x58.

# Book and tutorials

## Statistics with R: On the R-way to hell

::: {layout=[22,78]}
[![](../img/hex/Rway_logo_hex_en.png){width="150"}][R_way] 

::::{}
This is an introduction to statistics and R book with a multilingual approach.
The book is covering an introduction to the basic use of R (data loading, wrangling and plotting), as well as programming, use of github and R markdown /Quarto with R Studio and VS code. It then covers a lot of statistical subjects.

The book (still under development) is available in [English][R_way] and [French][chemin_R].
I will add more languages later this year hopefully with help of volunteers.

## How to fit an animal model {#wam_tuto}

::: {layout=[22,78]}
  
[![](../img/hex/wam_logo_hex.png){width="150"}](https://juliengamartin.github.io/wam_tuto/)

::::{}
The [book](https://juliengamartin.github.io/wam_tuto/) is tutorial on how to fit an animal model using multiple R packages. This is essentially an updated and extended version of the tutorials from "An ecologist guide to animal model" paper by @wilson2010.

# Statistical consulting {#consult}

::: {layout=[22,78]}
[![](../img/hex/consult_logo_hex.png){fig-align="right" width="150"}](people.qmd)   

::::{}
As Part of my service in the Biology department, I provide statistical consulting.
Please just contact me to book an appointment to discuss your stat problems.

Please bring with you (or send me in advance):

* your data
* your R code (should at least load the data into R)
* a clear working hypothesis
::::

Statistical consulting does not mean that you have to add me as a co-author. I just ask that you add me to the **"Acknowledgements"** of your thesis and manuscript/article. Repeated consulting on the same problem and my implication on developing project specific coding/analysis might lead to co-authorship, but this usually all comes naturally and is always discussed openly with the student(s) and PI(s). As yet, I have never requested to become a co-author and I was offered co-authorship for 3 manuscripts over > 50 projects discussed.

# Quarto templates for reproducible science {#quarto}

A few quarto templates I developed to facilitate open-science for students at uOttawa

* [bio-uo-proposal](https://github.com/JulienGAMartin/quarto-bio-uo-proposal):  
  quarto extension providing 1 new pdf output format (`bio-uo-proposal-pdf`). I am working on a docx version but tweaking the frontpage is tricky with word document.

* [bio-uo-thesis](https://github.com/JulienGAMartin/quarto-bio-uo-thesis):  
  quarto extension  providing two new output formats for book projects: an html (`bio-uo-thesis-html`) and a pdf (`bio-uo-thesis-pdf`) generating a website (to be hosted on github pages or similar) and a pdf of the thesis adequately formatted for uOttawa (at least biology)
